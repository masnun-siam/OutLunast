Our project name is “OutLunast”. The moon is the one and only satellite of the earth. Many more attempts have undertaken to uncover to truth and the mystery of the moon. Many missions are operated and some became successful and some are failing. Their success and failure have given us the most valuable thing, "Information about the moon" Our target is to use this data provided by NASA and make some new application of them.

NASA has announced a goal called “go-as-we-can-afford-to-pay” that will make the moon not only a far away, cool looking object to rise romance and patriotism on the human mind, but also it will help economically.

How would you feel if someone says it is possible to spend your time on the moon. You will stay in the 5 Star hotel on the moon. will walk in the dust, sit under the tree to take a rest while you are tired, swim in the lake, cultivate your own vegetable and cook them by yourself, enjoy your dinner on the roof, instead of the moon you will enjoy the view of far away glowing earth. Isn't it like a dream? We will try to make it possible. But in virtual reality. 

We go to the moon, build our hotels, building, plant trees, harvesting land, dig lakes, making power sources, and most of all, survive the unknown weather on the moon. It's a game in a virtual reality environment. From the departure to the receiving the guest of our moon domes, the progress will be done with different levels. 

To design our level, moon surface, environment, climate, soil, air and other component we will use NASA's data. It will help to understand the way how we can colonize moon, what kind of difficulty we can face to reach our goal, what will be the new technical requirements that are not managed yet and over all, it will be very much fun and educative.
